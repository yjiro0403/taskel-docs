# What is Taskel?

> **Taskel is not a "task management tool." It's an environment where your annual goals and today's actions are bidirectionally connected, and both your goals and yourself are refined with every action you take.**

## Seven Pillars

The seven design principles that power the Taskel experience.

### 1. Bidirectional Goal Connection

Annual goals → Monthly → Weekly → Today's actions. This hierarchy is connected by **a single thread**.

But it's not one-way. **Today's execution and insights rewrite your weekly, monthly, and annual goals.** When priorities shift due to recent work or events, goals are refined from the bottom up.

> No product on the market currently connects goal management and time execution bidirectionally in a single tool.

### 2. Visualizing the Reality of Time

Real-time display of estimated end time. When you line up your tasks in the morning and see "Today's estimated end: 11:40 PM," you can **judge "it won't fit" in 5 seconds**.

View tasks not as a "list" but as "time blocks." A day has 24 hours. Usable time is even less. This constraint gives you the **power to decide what NOT to do**.

### 3. Execution Drive

- **One-click Timer** — Just press play to start tracking
- **Sections** — Divide your day into time blocks (Morning / Afternoon / Evening, etc.) to focus on "what to do in the next 2 hours"
- **Focus Mode** — During execution, see only the task name and elapsed time

Taskel is not a planning tool — it's an **engine that drives execution**.

### 4. Self-Calibration (Time Mirror)

A feedback loop of estimated time vs. actual time. You estimate yourself, recognize the gap yourself, and sharpen your sense of time.

**Don't let AI handle your estimates.** This is the opposite philosophy from Motion/Reclaim. If you delegate, you lose the opportunity to sharpen your time sense. AI serves strictly as a "mirror" to help users' self-awareness.

### 5. Psychological Safety

- **Chute (Postpone / Carry Over)** — Tasks not finished today can flow to tomorrow without judgment. You can also choose to drop them entirely. No red "Overdue" hell.
- **User-driven flexibility** — Postpone, drop, or keep as-is. The system doesn't judge — you decide for yourself.

> **Incomplete ≠ failure.** This is the exit from the task swamp.

### 6. Habit Automation

The Routine feature automatically lines up daily/weekly recurring tasks. You don't need to decide "should I do this or not" every day. **Elimination of decision fatigue.**

If you skip a routine, postpone it or drop it — your call. The system never punishes.

### 7. Action Selection Optimization

- **Unscheduled** — A holding area for tasks with no set date. Keeps your today list clean, but nothing gets lost. "Don't forget. But don't interrupt today."
- **Scoring** — Inspired by the RICE framework, tasks are scored by Importance × Urgency. Importance includes goal contribution, so tasks directly linked to annual goals score higher.

## Supplement: Project Folders

As an organizational feature that supports all seven pillars, **Project Folders** allow you to classify and organize tasks by project. You can also share projects with others for collaboration.

## Three Design Philosophies

### Assist, not Delegate

AI functions as a "mirror." It shows your past data and suggests patterns. But it doesn't estimate for you or change your priorities. You estimate, you decide, you reflect. This "you do it yourself" process is what sharpens your sense of time and judgment.

### Incomplete is Not Punishment

Tasks not finished today are not "failures" — they're "handoffs to tomorrow." Chute (postponement) is an official feature and a legitimate choice. Postpone, drop, or keep — the flexibility for users to decide for themselves is protected.

### Goals Are Living Things

Goals that never change from January to December are unnatural. Recent work, encounters, discoveries, failures — any daily experience can rewrite your goals. Taskel **welcomes** goal evolution. Changing doesn't mean failing — changing means growing.

## Experience Summary

The experience created by the seven pillars, in one line:

> **No hesitation. No panic. No blame. Refined with every action.**

| Pillar | Experience |
|---|---|
| Goal Connection | **No hesitation** — Clear purpose for every action |
| Reality of Time | **No panic** — If it doesn't fit, tomorrow is fine |
| Execution Drive | **Unstoppable** — The timer pushes you forward |
| Self-Calibration | **Know yourself** — Your time sense is sharpened |
| Psychological Safety | **No self-blame** — Incomplete is not punishment |
| Habit Automation | **No thinking needed** — Routines are already lined up |
| Action Selection | **Easy to choose** — Scores guide you |
