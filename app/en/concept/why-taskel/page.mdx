## We Understand Your Pain

### Pain 1: The Task Swamp

This is the third time you've reinstalled Todoist. You built a Notion database, but stopped opening it after a week. Managing has become a task itself.

**Root cause:** Traditional task management tools just "line up things to do." The more you line up, the more the never-ending list generates guilt, and opening the tool becomes scary.

### Pain 2: The Gap Between Goals and Execution

You set goals in January — "study English," "start a side project." By March, they're forgotten. Goals live somewhere in Notion, today's tasks in Todoist. The two are disconnected.

**Root cause:** Goal management and execution management exist in separate tools and separate habits. The act of setting goals and the act of deciding what to do today are disconnected.

### Pain 3: Time Blindness

You lined up 10 things to do today. You planned to finish them all. But by evening, not even half are done. Is it poor estimation or lack of time? You can't tell.

**Root cause:** You're viewing tasks as a "list." Time is finite, but lists stretch infinitely. You're cramming without seeing "how much time is actually left today."

### Pain 4: Guilt from Incomplete Tasks

Overdue tasks line up in red. Every time you see them, you feel judged. Eventually, you stop opening the tool.

**Root cause:** Traditional tools punish incompletion with "Overdue" labels. When humans are punished, they flee.

## What Taskel Solves

| Pain | Traditional Tools | Taskel's Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Task swamp** | Just lines up things to do | Select only what truly matters by working backward from goals (Scoring) |
| **Goal-execution gap** | Goal and execution management are separate | Year → Month → Week → Today in a single thread. Bidirectionally connected |
| **Time blindness** | Lists stretch infinitely | Real-time estimated end time. Know in 5 seconds if it won't fit |
| **Incomplete guilt** | Red "Overdue" punishment | Chute (postponement) is an official feature. Incomplete ≠ failure |

## Fundamental Differences from Competitors

### Todoist / TickTick / Microsoft To Do

**Essence:** To-do list

You can create lists. Set deadlines. But they don't answer "why am I doing this?" or "will I actually finish today?" No goal connection, no visibility of time's finiteness.

| | Todoist etc. | Taskel |
|---|---|---|
| Goal connection | ❌ None | ✅ Year → Month → Week → Today, bidirectional |
| Time visualization | ❌ List only | ✅ Real-time estimated end time |
| Incomplete handling | ⚠️ Overdue (red) | ✅ Chute (no punishment) |
| Execution drive | ❌ None | ✅ One-click timer |

### Notion

**Essence:** All-purpose workspace

It can do everything. But precisely because it can do everything, there's no design for task management. You start by building databases, and operation design is left to the user. "Managing itself becomes a task."

| | Notion | Taskel |
|---|---|---|
| Goal connection | △ Possible if you design it yourself | ✅ Structured from the start |
| Execution drive | ❌ None | ✅ Timer + Sections + Focus Mode |
| Setup cost | ⚠️ High (design required) | ✅ Low (just follow the method) |

### Motion / Reclaim

**Essence:** AI schedule optimization

AI auto-places tasks in calendar gaps. Efficiency might improve. But it takes away the opportunity to "estimate yourself and judge yourself." Time sense deteriorates the more you depend on AI.

| | Motion / Reclaim | Taskel |
|---|---|---|
| AI's role | Full auto-optimization | Mirror (self-awareness aid) |
| Time sense | Depends on AI (not sharpened) | Self-calibrated (sharpened) |
| Goal connection | ❌ None | ✅ Bidirectional connection |
| Philosophy | Maximize efficiency | You're refined with every action |

### TaskChute Family (TaskChute Cloud / Taskuma)

**Essence:** Record all time and develop time awareness

The execution layer of the Taskel Method inherits TaskChute's philosophy. It's the closest DNA.

However, TaskChute lacks "hierarchical goal connection." There's no structure for "why you're doing it," and goal management is delegated to other tools.

| | TaskChute Family | Taskel |
|---|---|---|
| Time-ordered tasks | ✅ | ✅ |
| Estimate vs. actual | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hierarchical goal connection | ❌ | ✅ Year → Month → Week → Today |
| Bidirectional goal revision | ❌ | ✅ Execution refines goals |
| Psychological safety | △ | ✅ Chute + flexible judgment |
| Action selection optimization | ❌ | ✅ Scoring + Unscheduled |

### Any Planner

**Essence:** Daily planner for ADHD

Simple and easy to use. Empathetic to ADHD users. But no goal connection, no structure for "why you're doing it."

| | Any Planner | Taskel |
|---|---|---|
| Goal connection | ❌ | ✅ Bidirectional connection |
| Time visualization | △ Timeline | ✅ Estimated end time + Sections |
| AI utilization | ❌ | ✅ Used as a mirror |
| Method provided | ❌ | ✅ 8-step cycle |
