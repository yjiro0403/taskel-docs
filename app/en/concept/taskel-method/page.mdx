> **Bring your goals into today, and let today rewrite your goals. Your daily 30 minutes will change your year.**

## What is the Taskel Method?

The Taskel Method is **a methodology for bidirectionally connecting your annual goals with today's actions, running a daily cycle of execution, measurement, and reflection to continuously refine both your goals and yourself**.

The Taskel app is the tool that makes practicing this method as easy as possible.

### The Relationship Between Method and App

Just as TaskChute spread as a "method" and tools (TaskChute Cloud, Taskuma, etc.) were born later as implementations, Taskel also has the structure of **philosophy first, app second**.

| | Method | App |
|---|---|---|
| **What it provides** | A way of thinking and practicing | Mechanisms to run the method |
| **Can it work without the other?** | In principle, yes (pen and paper) | Without the method, it's just a feature set |
| **Source of value** | Resonance with the philosophy | Ease of practice and quality of experience |

## The 8-Step Cycle

```
Step 1: Set annual goals
    ↓
Step 2: Break down to Monthly → Weekly → Today
    ↓
Step 3: Arrange today's tasks by time blocks (Sections)
    ↓
Step 4: Add time estimates
    ↓
Step 5: Execute with the timer
    ↓
Step 6: If unfinished, flow to tomorrow (Chute). Don't blame yourself
    ↓
Step 7: Reflect on estimate vs. actual gaps (Time Mirror)
    ↓
Step 8: Revise weekly/monthly/annual goals based on today's insights
    ↓
Next day, return to Step 3
```

### Structure of the Cycle

| Phase | Steps | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **Break goals into actions (Top-down)** | Step 1-2 | Set annual goals and break them down to monthly → weekly → today |
| **Execute actions** | Step 3-5 | Arrange by time blocks, add estimates, execute with timer |
| **Accept results, know yourself** | Step 6-7 | Chute if unfinished. Calibrate with estimate vs. actual |
| **Actions refine goals (Bottom-up)** | Step 8 | Revise goals based on today's insights |

### Step 8 is the Core

Most methods end at Step 1-7. Set goals, break them down, execute, reflect. But that reflection **never rewrites the goals themselves**.

Only the Taskel Method has a **bidirectional cycle that feeds execution results back into goals**.

## Each Step in Detail

### Step 1: Set Annual Goals

Put into words what you want to achieve in a year. It doesn't need to be perfect. **Goals are living things** — they're expected to change.

Use Taskel's goal screen (Yearly View) to set your annual goals.

### Step 2: Break Down to Monthly → Weekly → Today

Break annual goals into monthly goals, then weekly goals, then today's actions.

"Reach business-level English" → "March: Score 800+ on TOEIC" → "This week: Solve 100 Part 5 questions" → "Today: Solve 20 Part 5 questions (30 min)"

The key is that this hierarchy is connected by **a single thread**.

### Step 3: Arrange Today's Tasks by Time Blocks

Distribute today's tasks across sections (Morning / Afternoon / Evening, etc.). By viewing tasks as "time blocks" rather than a "list," the reality of your day becomes visible.

### Step 4: Add Time Estimates

Add estimated time to each task. At this point, the estimated end time is displayed. If you see "Today's estimated end: 11:40 PM," you know in 5 seconds that it won't all fit.

**Don't delegate to AI.** Estimating yourself is the first step to sharpening your time sense.

### Step 5: Execute with the Timer

Just press play to start tracking. Focus Mode lets you concentrate on just the task name and elapsed time.

**The bridge from planning to execution** — that's the role of the one-click timer.

### Step 6: Chute if Unfinished

Tasks not finished today can flow to tomorrow without judgment. You can also choose to drop them entirely.

Postpone, drop, or keep as-is. **You decide.**

> Incomplete ≠ failure. This is the exit from the task swamp.

### Step 7: Time Mirror (Estimate vs. Actual Reflection)

Review the gap between estimated and actual time. AI shows your past data and suggests patterns, but the judgment is always yours.

This feedback loop sharpens your sense of time.

### Step 8: Revise Goals Based on Today's Insights

This is **the core of the Taskel Method**.

Based on what you felt and noticed from today's execution, revise your weekly, monthly, and annual goals. "This goal might not fit me anymore." "I realized this other thing matters more." — Such changes are welcomed.

**Changing doesn't mean failing — changing means growing.**

## Relationship with Prior Methods

The Taskel Method **respects, integrates, and extends** the wisdom of prior methods.

### TaskChute Method

**Relationship: Encompasses and extends**

TaskChute's philosophy of "line up all daily tasks in time order, add estimates, and execute from top to bottom" is inherited directly by the Taskel Method's execution layer (Steps 3-7).

What the Taskel Method adds:
- **Hierarchical goal connection** (Steps 1-2)
- **Bidirectional goal revision** (Step 8)
- **Action selection optimization** (Scoring + Unscheduled)

### OKR (Objectives and Key Results)

**Relationship: Borrowed the philosophy, translated for individuals**

OKR's philosophy of "hierarchically breaking down goals into actions" was **translated into a form that individuals can run daily without strain**.

Fundamental differences:
- OKR is **top-down one-way** → Taskel Method is **bidirectional**
- OKR runs on **quarterly cycles** → Taskel Method runs **daily**
- OKR is **too heavy for individuals** → Taskel Method is **dissolved into the daily execution loop**

### GTD (Getting Things Done)

**Relationship: Partially borrowed**

GTD's philosophy of "entrust everything in your head to a reliable system" is inherited by **Unscheduled**. "Don't forget. But don't interrupt today."

### RICE Framework

**Relationship: Applied the scoring philosophy**

RICE's philosophy of "creating decision-making basis through multi-axis scoring" is applied to personal action selection. Tasks are scored by Importance (including goal contribution) × Urgency.

### Pomodoro Technique

**Relationship: Referenced the timer execution philosophy**

The philosophy of "creating focused intervals with a timer" lives on in the one-click timer and Focus Mode. However, instead of fixed 25-minute cycles, Taskel uses flexible per-task estimated times.

## The Uniqueness of the Taskel Method

### Each element exists. The integration is new.

As shown above, each element of the Taskel Method has predecessors. **However, no one has proposed integrating these into an "8-step daily cycle" that bidirectionally refines goals.**

Just as the iPhone unified the phone, music player, and internet into one device, the Taskel Method integrates the following into a single cycle:

- **TaskChute** (execution drive + time sense calibration)
- **OKR** (goal hierarchy) → extended to be bidirectional
- **Psychological safety** (incomplete ≠ failure)
- **RICE** (action selection scoring) → with goal contribution built in
- **GTD** (entrust to a reliable system) → as Unscheduled

## Method Philosophy

### Assist, not Delegate

AI is a "mirror." It shows past data and suggests patterns. But it doesn't estimate for you or change your priorities. **You estimate, you decide, you reflect.** This "do it yourself" process sharpens your time sense and judgment.

### Incomplete is Not Punishment

Tasks not finished today are not "failures" — they're "handoffs to tomorrow." Postponement is an official feature and a legitimate choice.

### Goals Are Living Things

Goals that never change from January to December are unnatural. Daily experiences can rewrite your goals. **Changing doesn't mean failing — changing means growing.**
