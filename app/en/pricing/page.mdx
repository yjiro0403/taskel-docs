## FAQ

### Are there any limitations on task management features in the Free plan?

No. Task management, time tracking, goal management, sections, views, and all non-AI features are completely free with no limitations.

### What happens when I reach my AI request limit?

When you reach the limit, a dialog will appear suggesting an upgrade when you try to send a message in the AI chat panel. You can either wait for the monthly reset or upgrade to a higher plan.

### Is billing prorated when I change plans mid-cycle?

Based on Stripe's billing system, upgrades are prorated and you'll be charged the difference. Downgrades take effect at the next billing date.
