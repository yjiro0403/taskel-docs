# Practicing the Taskel Method

> **Weave the 8-step cycle into your daily life.**

This page shows how to integrate the [Taskel Method](/en/concept/taskel-method)'s 8 steps into the rhythm of your day, week, and month.

## Morning: Planning (Step 3 + Step 4)

**What to do:** Arrange today's tasks by time blocks and add time estimates

1. Open **Daily View**.
2. Check incomplete tasks from yesterday (Chuted) and tasks to do today.
3. Distribute tasks into **Morning / Afternoon / Evening** sections.
4. Add **time estimates** to each task.
5. Check the **estimated end time**. If it shows "11:40 PM," it won't fit. Move something to tomorrow.

> **💡 Key point:** Estimate yourself (Step 4). Don't delegate to AI. Estimating yourself is the first step to sharpening your time sense.

**AI Tip**: Ask the AI "Show me today's tasks" for a quick status overview. "What are my goals this week?" helps confirm priorities.

## Daytime: Execution (Step 5)

**What to do:** Execute with the timer

1. Press the **Play button (▶)** on the first task.
2. Use **Focus Mode** to see only the task name and elapsed time.
3. When finished, press the **Stop button (■)** to complete it and start the next task.
4. If you come up with ideas or tasks, press `N` to quickly add them and return to your current work.

> **💡 Key point:** Pressing play — that's the "bridge from planning to execution" (Step 5).

**AI Tip**: Tell the AI "Start email replies now" to create a task and auto-start the timer. For interruptions, "Interruption — phone call" will pause the current task and start a new one instantly.

## Evening: Reflection (Step 6 + Step 7)

**What to do:** Chute if unfinished, reflect on estimate vs. actual gaps

1. Check if all tasks are completed.
2. For **incomplete tasks**, use Chute to flow them to tomorrow, or decide to drop them. **Don't blame yourself.**
3. Click the **Daily Note** icon and jot down today's insights.
4. Review the **estimate vs. actual** gap. "The 30-minute estimate actually took 50 minutes" — this awareness sharpens your time sense.

> **💡 Key point:** Incomplete ≠ failure (Step 6). Recognize the gap between estimate and actual (Step 7: Time Mirror).

**AI Tip**: Ask "Review my day" for an auto-generated report covering completion rate, estimation accuracy, and goal progress. "Check my estimation accuracy" helps tune your time sense over time.

## Start of Week: Breakdown (Step 2)

**What to do:** Break monthly goals → this week's goals → today's actions

1. Open **Weekly View** to check and set this week's goals.
2. Working backward from monthly goals, write specific things to do this week.
3. Decide whether to carry over last week's incomplete tasks.
4. Add tasks connected to this week's goals into today's Daily View.

> **💡 Key point:** "Reach business-level English" → "March: Score 800+ on TOEIC" → "This week: Solve 100 Part 5 questions" → "Today: Solve 20 Part 5 questions." Keep this single thread in mind (Step 2).

**AI Tip**: Ask "Break down this month's goal into tasks" to get batch task suggestions from your goals.

## Start of Month/Year: Goal Setting & Revision (Step 1 + Step 8)

**What to do:** Set annual goals / Revise goals based on insights

### New Year / Getting Started (Step 1)
1. Set annual goals in **Yearly View**.
2. They don't need to be perfect. **Goals are living things** — they're expected to change.
3. Break annual goals into monthly goals using **Monthly View**.

### Every Day / Week / Month (Step 8)
1. Based on what you noticed in reflection (Step 7), revise your goals.
2. "This goal might not fit me anymore." "I realized this other thing matters more." — **Welcome** such changes.
3. Record goal changes and their reasons in **Weekly Notes** or **Monthly Notes**.

> **💡 Key point:** Step 8 is the core of the Taskel Method. Changing doesn't mean failing — **changing means growing**.
