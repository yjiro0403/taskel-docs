# Recommended Workflow

Here is an example of an ideal daily flow using Taskel.

## Morning: Planning

1. Open **Daily View**.
2. Check incomplete tasks from yesterday and tasks to do today.
3. Distribute tasks into **Morning / Afternoon / Evening** sections.
4. Once you decide "the tasks I must finish today", preparation is complete.

**AI Tip**: Ask the AI "Show me today's tasks" for a quick status overview. "What are my goals this week?" helps confirm priorities.

## Daytime: Execution

1. Press the **Play button** on the first task.
2. Concentrate on your work.
3. When finished, check the box to complete it and start the next task.
4. If you come up with ideas or tasks, add them to Inbox immediately with a shortcut and return to your current work.

**AI Tip**: Tell the AI "Start email replies now" to create a task and auto-start the timer. For interruptions, "Interruption — phone call" will pause the current task and start a new one instantly.

## Night: Review

1. Check if all tasks are completed.
2. Click the **Daily Note** icon and note down today's insights.
3. Briefly check tomorrow's schedule and finish.

**AI Tip**: Ask "Review my day" for an auto-generated report covering completion rate, estimation accuracy, and goal progress. "Check my estimation accuracy" helps tune your time sense over time.
