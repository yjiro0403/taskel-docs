# Recommended Workflow

Here is an example of an ideal daily flow using Taskel.

## Morning: Planning

1. Open **Daily View**.
2. Check incomplete tasks from yesterday and tasks to do today.
3. Distribute tasks into **Morning / Afternoon / Evening** sections.
4. Once you decide "the tasks I must finish today", preparation is complete.

**AI Tip**: Ask the AI "Show me today's tasks" for a quick status overview. "What are my goals this week?" helps confirm priorities.

## Daytime: Execution

1. Press the **Play button (▶)** on the first task.
2. Concentrate on your work.
3. When finished, press the **Stop button (■)** to complete it and start the next task.
4. If you come up with ideas or tasks, press `N` to quickly add them and return to your current work.

**AI Tip**: Tell the AI "Start email replies now" to create a task and auto-start the timer. For interruptions, "Interruption — phone call" will pause the current task and start a new one instantly.

## Night: Review

1. Check if all tasks are completed.
2. Click the **Daily Note** icon (document icon on the date bar) and note down today's insights.
3. Briefly check tomorrow's schedule and finish.

**AI Tip**: Ask "Review my day" for an auto-generated report covering completion rate, estimation accuracy, and goal progress. "Check my estimation accuracy" helps tune your time sense over time.
