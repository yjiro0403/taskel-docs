# AI Assistant

Taskel comes with a built-in AI assistant that supports your task management through natural conversation. Add tasks, check your progress, and review your day — all through chat.

> **💡 WHY — Assist, not Delegate**
> AI functions as a "mirror." It shows your past data and suggests patterns. But it doesn't estimate for you or change your priorities. You estimate, you decide, you reflect — this "do it yourself" process is protected.

> **User Agency**: The AI only makes "suggestions". It never creates or modifies tasks without your explicit confirmation. You always have the final say.

> **Pricing**: Some AI features are available on paid plans only. Basic features like adding tasks and checking today's tasks are free. Advanced analytics such as Goal Breakdown, Time Calibration, and Daily Review require the Pro plan. See the pricing page for details.

## Adding Tasks

Simply tell the AI what you want to do, and it will suggest a task as a preview card.

**Example: "Review the proposal at 2pm, about 45 minutes"**

The AI automatically determines:
- **Task name**: "Review the proposal"
- **Start time**: 14:00
- **Estimated time**: 45 minutes
- **Section**: Automatically placed in the Afternoon section based on the time

Review the suggestion card and press **"Create"** to add it. You can edit the title, time, or other details before creating.

### Start Immediately Mode

Phrases like "**Start** email replies **now**" or "**Interruption** — phone call" will create the task and auto-start the timer. Any running task is automatically paused, making interruptions smooth.

---

## Checking Today's Tasks

Ask **"Show me today's tasks"** to see a quick summary:

Display includes:
- Total task count
- Completed / Incomplete / In Progress breakdown
- Total estimated vs actual time

Ask "Suggest what I should do today" for AI-powered task recommendations based on your current situation.

---

## Goal Integration

### Viewing Goals

Ask **"What are my goals this month?"** to see all active goals — yearly, monthly, and weekly.

### Goal Breakdown

Tell the AI **"Break down this goal into tasks"** and it will:

1. Analyze the goal's content and check existing tasks
2. Suggest ~5 new tasks that don't duplicate existing ones
3. Show a batch preview for you to check and select which to create

Each task is automatically linked to the goal, so task completion is reflected in goal progress.

---

## Time Calibration

Ask **"Check my estimation accuracy"** to see a report analyzing gaps between your estimates and actual time spent.

### Calibration Report Includes

- **Accuracy ratio**: Actual / Estimated (100% is ideal)
- **Average deviation**: How far off your estimates are on average
- **Most deviated tasks**: Top 5 biggest gaps
- **Category accuracy**: Trends by tag

### How It Helps

When calibration data is available, the AI automatically adjusts time estimates when suggesting tasks.

> Example: If you tend to exceed estimates by 50%, the AI might say:
> "This type of task usually takes about 45 minutes. Shall I estimate 45 minutes?"

## Daily Review

Ask **"Review my day"** to generate a comprehensive end-of-day report.

### Report Includes

- **Completion rate**: Large number with progress bar for quick overview
- **Stats**: Completed / Incomplete / Total time / Estimation accuracy
- **Completed tasks**: Title + Estimate → Actual (color-coded deviation)
- **Incomplete tasks**: Status display (In Progress / Not Started)
- **Skipped tasks**: Listed
- **Goal progress**: Per-goal breakdown for today's work
- **AI message**: Feedback based on completion rate

### Feedback Based on Completion Rate

| Rate | Example Message |
|------|----------------|
| 80%+ | "Great day! Well done!" |
| 50-79% | "Steady progress" |
| Below 50% | "Let's organize what to carry over to tomorrow" |

### Review Previous Days

Ask **"Review yesterday"** to generate a report for the previous day.

## FAQ

### Will the AI create tasks without my permission?

No. The AI only makes "suggestions". A preview card is shown, and nothing is written to the database until you press the "Create" button. You can dismiss any suggestion with the "Reject" button.

### Which AI model is used?

Gemini 2.5 Flash is used by default. You can switch models using the selector in the chat panel.

### Is my conversation history saved?

Conversations are displayed during the session but reset when you close the panel. Only tasks you explicitly create are saved to Firestore.
