# AI Assistant

Taskel comes with a built-in AI assistant that supports your task management through natural conversation. Add tasks, check your progress, and review your day — all through chat.

> **User Agency**: The AI only makes "suggestions". It never creates or modifies tasks without your explicit confirmation. You always have the final say.

## Opening the AI Assistant

Click the **Sparkles button** at the bottom-right of the screen. The AI chat panel slides in from the right.

## Adding Tasks

Simply tell the AI what you want to do, and it will suggest a task as a preview card.

**Example: "Review the proposal at 2pm, about 45 minutes"**

The AI automatically determines:
- **Task name**: "Review the proposal"
- **Start time**: 14:00
- **Estimated time**: 45 minutes
- **Section**: Automatically placed in the Afternoon section

Review the suggestion card and press **"Create"** to add it. You can edit the title, time, or other details before creating.

### Start Immediately Mode

Phrases like "**Start** email replies **now**" or "**Interruption** — phone call" will create the task and auto-start the timer. Any running task is automatically paused.

---

## Checking Today's Tasks

Ask **"Show me today's tasks"** to see a quick summary:

- Total task count
- Completed / Open / In Progress breakdown
- Total estimated vs actual time

Ask "Suggest what I should do today" for AI-powered task recommendations based on your current situation.

---

## Goal Integration

### Viewing Goals

Ask **"What are my goals this month?"** to see all active goals — yearly, monthly, and weekly.

### Goal Breakdown

Tell the AI **"Break down this goal into tasks"** and it will:

1. Check the goal's content and existing tasks
2. Suggest ~5 new tasks that don't duplicate existing ones
3. Show a batch preview for you to check and create

Each task is automatically linked to the goal for progress tracking.

## Time Calibration

Ask **"Check my estimation accuracy"** to see a report analyzing gaps between your estimates and actual time spent.

### Calibration Report Includes

- **Accuracy ratio**: Actual / Estimated (100% is ideal)
- **Average deviation**: How far off your estimates are on average
- **Most deviated tasks**: Top 5 biggest gaps
- **Category accuracy**: Trends by tag

{/* ![Calibration Report](/images/calibration-report.png) */}

### How It Helps

When calibration data is available, the AI automatically adjusts time estimates when suggesting tasks.

> Example: If you tend to exceed estimates by 50%, the AI might say:
> "This type of task usually takes about 45 minutes. Shall I estimate 45 minutes?"

## Daily Review

Ask **"Review my day"** to generate a comprehensive end-of-day report.

### Report Includes

- **Completion rate**: Large number with progress bar
- **Stats**: Completed / Incomplete / Total time / Estimation accuracy
- **Completed tasks**: Title + Estimate vs Actual (color-coded deviation)
- **Incomplete tasks**: Status display (In Progress / Not Started)
- **Skipped tasks**: Listed
- **Goal progress**: Per-goal breakdown for today's work
- **AI message**: Feedback based on completion rate

{/* ![Daily Review Report](/images/daily-review.png) */}

### Feedback Based on Completion Rate

| Rate | Example Message |
|------|----------------|
| 80%+ | "Great day! Well done!" |
| 50-79% | "Steady progress" |
| Below 50% | "Let's organize what to carry over to tomorrow" |

### Review Previous Days

Ask **"Review yesterday"** to generate a report for the previous day.

## FAQ

### Will the AI create tasks without my permission?

No. The AI only makes "suggestions". A preview card is shown, and nothing is written to the database until you press the "Create" button. You can dismiss any suggestion.

### Which AI model is used?

Gemini 2.5 Flash is used by default. You can switch models using the selector in the chat panel.

### Is my conversation history saved?

Conversations are displayed during the session but reset when you close the panel. Only tasks you explicitly create are saved to Firestore.
