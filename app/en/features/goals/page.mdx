# Goal Management

You can manage medium to long-term goals as well as short-term tasks, linking them to daily actions.

> **💡 WHY — Pillar 1: Bidirectional Goal Connection**
> Annual goals → Monthly → Weekly → Today's actions. This hierarchy is connected by a single thread. And it's not one-way — today's execution and insights rewrite your goals. This keeps "why you're doing it" always clear.

## Hierarchy of Goals

1. **Yearly Goals**: Major goals you want to achieve in a year.
    - Example: `Launch a personal development product`
2. **Monthly Goals**: Monthly milestones.
    - Example: `Release beta version`
3. **Weekly Goals**: Weekly actions.
    - Example: `Complete API design`

## How to Set Goals

1. There is a goal list in the sidebar (or top) on the left side of each view (Yearly/Monthly/Weekly).
2. Enter into `Add a goal...` and press `Enter` to add.
3. Once achieved, click the checkbox to mark as complete.

## AI Goal Breakdown Integration

Tell the AI assistant **"Break down this goal into tasks"** and it will break down the goal into specific tasks and suggest them.

1. The AI analyzes the goal's content
2. Suggests ~5 task candidates needed to achieve the goal
3. Shows a batch preview; select and create only the ones you need

The created tasks are automatically linked to the goal, so task completion is reflected in goal progress.
