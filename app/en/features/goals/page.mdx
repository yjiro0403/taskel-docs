# Goal Management

You can manage potential long-term goals as well as short-term tasks, linking them to daily actions.

## Hierarchy of Goals

1. **Yearly Goals**: Major goals you want to achieve in a year.
    - Example: `Read 100 books`
2. **Monthly Goals**: Monthly milestones.
    - Example: `Read 8 books this month`
3. **Weekly Goals**: Weekly actions.
    - Example: `Read for 30 minutes every day`

## How to Set Goals

2. Enter into `Add a goal...` and press `Enter` to add.
3. Once achieved, click the checkbox to mark as complete.
