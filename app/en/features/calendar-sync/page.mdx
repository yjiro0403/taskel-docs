# Google Calendar Sync

Import Google Calendar events into Taskel and manage them centrally as tasks.

> **💡 WHY — Pillar 2: Visualizing the Reality of Time**
> By importing calendar events, "time that's already taken" becomes visible. You can plan today's tasks knowing the reality of your remaining time.

1. Open **Daily View** and click the **"Sync Google Calendar"** button next to the date navigation.
2. A Google sign-in popup will appear. Sign in and allow access to your calendar.
3. Once sync is complete, calendar events will appear on Taskel's timeline for the selected day.
4. To re-sync, click the same **"Sync Google Calendar"** button again.
