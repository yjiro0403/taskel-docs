## Trends

- Check trends in completed tasks and total working time with **line graphs**.
- Objectively judge "Did I work harder than last week?" or "Am I working too much?".
- Day-by-day and week-by-week comparisons are available.

## Breakdown

- Check time allocation by project or tag with **pie charts**.
- Useful for discovering bottlenecks like "Which project am I spending too much time on?".
- Category analysis by tags (Development, Meetings, Admin, Learning, Health, etc.) helps you understand the balance of how you spend your time.
