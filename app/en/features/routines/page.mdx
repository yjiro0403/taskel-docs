# Routines

Automate repetitive tasks and support habit formation.

## Creating a Routine

1. Select the **"Routines"** menu from the sidebar.
2. Click the `New Routine` button.
3. Set the **Frequency**.
    - **Daily**: Every day (specific days of the week possible)
    - **Weekly**: Specific day every week
    - **Monthly**: Specific day every month
4. Set details like time and project, then save.

## Virtual Tasks and Materialization

- When you set a routine, it appears faintly as a **"Virtual Task"** on the calendar.
- When the day comes or you edit it, it turns into a **"Real Task"** and can be operated like a normal task.
