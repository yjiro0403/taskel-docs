# Routines

Automate repetitive tasks and support habit formation.

> **💡 WHY — Pillar 6: Habit Automation**
> Deciding "should I do this or not" every day is decision fatigue. When routines are automatically lined up, you don't need to think about it. If you skip a day, postpone or drop it — your call. The system never punishes.

## Creating a Routine

1. Select the **"Routines"** menu from the sidebar.
2. Click the `New Routine` button.
3. Set the **Frequency**.
    - **Daily**: Every day (specific days of the week possible)
    - **Weekly**: Specific day every week
    - **Monthly**: Specific day every month
4. Set details like time, project, and tags, then save.

## Virtual Tasks and Materialization

When you set a routine, it appears faintly as a **"Virtual Task"** in Daily View.

Virtual tasks are converted to **"Real Tasks"** at the following times, and can then be operated like normal tasks:

1. **When the day arrives**: Automatically materialized when you open Daily View
2. **When you edit it**: Materialized when you click the virtual task and modify its content
3. **When you press the Play button**: Materialized when you start time tracking

Materialized tasks can be completed with Play → Stop like normal tasks, and actual time is recorded.
