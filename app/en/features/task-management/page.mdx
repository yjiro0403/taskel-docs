> **💡 WHY — Pillar 3+5: Execution Drive + Psychological Safety**
> Creating, editing, and reordering tasks is the foundation that drives execution. And the Chute (postponement) feature ensures incomplete tasks are not punished. Postpone, drop, or keep — you decide.

## Basic Operations

- **Edit**: Click on a task to open the detailed edit modal. You can edit the title, estimated time, project, tags, and more.
- **Execute**: Click the **Play button (▶)** on the right side of the task to start time tracking. The task becomes "In Progress" and is highlighted with a pulse animation.
- **Complete**: Click the **Stop button (■)** on the running task to mark it as Done, and the actual time is automatically recorded.
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon in the task detail modal to delete it.
- **Duplicate**: Click the duplicate icon to copy the task with the same content.

> **Key Point**: In Taskel, you don't "check a box to complete" tasks. Instead, you **Play → Stop to complete** them. This ensures that the actual time spent is automatically recorded, helping you improve estimation accuracy.

## Multi-selection and Bulk Actions

The **circular icon (selection circle)** on the left side of tasks is for multi-selection.

1. Click the selection circle on the left side of tasks. You can select multiple tasks.
2. A **SelectionHeader (bulk action menu)** appears at the top of the screen.
3. The following actions are available:
    - **Delete**: Delete all selected tasks
    - **Change Date**: Move selected tasks to another date

## Filtering

You can narrow down tasks using the search function in the right sidebar.

- **Text Search**: Search by title or memo content
- **Project**: Show only tasks for a specific project
- **Tag**: Show only tasks with a specific tag

## Task Display Order

Tasks within each section are automatically sorted by the following priority:

| Priority | Rule | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Status** | Done → In Progress → Open |
| 2 | **Scheduled Time** | Scheduled tasks are sorted by `scheduledStart` in ascending order |
| 3 | **Schedule Presence** | Scheduled tasks appear above unscheduled tasks |
| 4 | **Manual Order** | Tasks follow the `order` set by drag-and-drop |

### Status Grouping

Within the same section, **completed tasks always appear at the top**.
This creates a timeline view where your daily progress is visible at a glance.

- ✅ Done → Top of the section
- ▶️ In Progress → Middle
- ○ Open → Bottom of the section

### Chronological Order

Scheduled tasks are ordered by `scheduledStart` (planned start time) in ascending order.

Example: If tasks in the same section are scheduled at 09:00, 10:30, and 11:00, they will appear in that order.

## Drag & Drop (Reordering)

All tasks (including scheduled and completed ones) can be reordered by dragging.

### Reordering Within a Section

Drag a task and drop it to another position within the same section.
The `order` value is automatically calculated based on the drop position.

### Moving Between Sections

Drag a task to a different section to move it there.
It will be inserted at the end of the target section or at the specified position.

### Importing Unscheduled Tasks

Drag unscheduled tasks from the right sidebar into the main timeline to assign them to a section.
