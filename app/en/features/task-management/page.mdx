# Task Management

## Basic Operations

- **Edit**: Click on a task to edit its details.
- **Complete**: Click the checkbox to mark the task as Done.
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to delete.
- **Duplicate**: Click the duplicate icon to copy the task with the same content.

## Bulk Actions

You can select multiple tasks and perform actions on them at once.

1. Click the selection circle on the left side of the task. You can select multiple tasks.
2. A bulk action menu will appear at the top of the screen.
3. The following actions are possible:
    - **Delete**: Delete all selected tasks
    - **Change Date**: Move selected tasks to another date

## Filtering

You can narrow down tasks using the search function in the right sidebar.

- **Text Search**: Search by title or memo content
- **Project**: Show only tasks for a specific project
- **Tag**: Show only tasks with a specific tag

## Task Display Order

Tasks within each section are automatically sorted by the following priority:

| Priority | Rule | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Status** | Done → In Progress → Open |
| 2 | **Scheduled Time** | Scheduled tasks are sorted by `scheduledStart` in ascending order |
| 3 | **Schedule Presence** | Scheduled tasks appear above unscheduled tasks |
| 4 | **Manual Order** | Tasks follow the `order` set by drag-and-drop |

### Status Grouping

Within the same section, **completed tasks always appear at the top**.
This creates a timeline view where your daily progress is visible at a glance.

- ✅ Done → Top of the section
- ▶️ In Progress → Middle
- ○ Open → Bottom of the section

### Chronological Order

Scheduled tasks are ordered by `scheduledStart` (planned start time) in ascending order.

Example: If tasks in the same section are scheduled at 09:00, 10:30, and 11:00, they will appear in that order.

## Drag & Drop (Reordering)

All tasks (including scheduled and completed ones) can be reordered by dragging.

### Reordering Within a Section

Drag a task and drop it to another position within the same section.
The `order` value is automatically calculated based on the drop position.

### Moving Between Sections

Drag a task to a different section to move it there.
It will be inserted at the end of the target section or at the specified position.

### Importing Unscheduled Tasks

Drag unscheduled tasks from the right sidebar into the main timeline to assign them to a section.
