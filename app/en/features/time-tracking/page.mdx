# Time Tracking

The biggest feature of Taskel is its time tracking function that supports "immersion" during task execution.

> **💡 WHY — Pillar 3+4: Execution Drive + Self-Calibration (Time Mirror)**
> Just press play to start tracking. This one click bridges the gap from planning to execution. And the feedback loop of estimated vs. actual time sharpens your sense of time.

## Start Tracking

1. Click the **Play button (▶)** on the right side of the task.
2. The task becomes "In Progress" and the **pulse animation** begins.
3. When you start another task, tracking for the previous task stops automatically (**Forced Single Tasking**).

## Stop Tracking and Completion

1. Click the **Stop button (■)** on the running task.
2. The task status changes to **Done**.
3. The tracked time is automatically recorded as "Actual Time".

> **Key Point**: In Taskel, pressing the Stop button marks the task as Done. There is no option to "just stop tracking while keeping the task incomplete". This design encourages you to "finish what you start".

## Checking Records

- You can check the total time spent on that task in the task detail modal.
- In the **Analytics** screen, you can check the daily total tracking time trends in graphs.
- The AI's **Time Calibration** feature can analyze gaps between your estimates and actual time.
