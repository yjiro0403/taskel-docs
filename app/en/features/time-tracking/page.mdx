# Time Tracking

The biggest feature of Taskel is its time tracking function that supports "immersion" during task execution.

## Start Tracking

1. Click the **Play button** on the right side of the task.
2. The task becomes "In Progress" and the **pulse animation** begins.
3. When you start another task, tracking for the previous task stops automatically (Forced Single Tasking).

## Stop Tracking

1. Click the **Stop button**.
2. The tracked time is recorded as "Actual Time".

## Checking Records

- You can check the total time spent on that task in the task details screen.
- In the **Analytics** screen, you can check the daily total tracking time trends.
