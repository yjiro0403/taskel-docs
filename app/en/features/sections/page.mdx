# Section Management

By dividing the day into sections like "Morning", "Afternoon", and "Evening", you create a rhythm.

## Add/Edit Sections

1. Click the gear icon (Settings) on the right side of the date bar.
2. You can add a new section with the **"Add New Section"** button.
3. Edit the section name (e.g., "Focus Time") and start time (e.g., "10:00").
4. Click `Save` to reflect changes in the main task list.

## Reflection on Schedule

The start time set for a section serves as a guide for task placement in the timeline view.
