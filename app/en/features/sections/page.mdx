# Section Management

By dividing the day into sections like "Morning", "Afternoon", and "Evening", you create a rhythm.

> **💡 WHY — Pillar 2: Visualizing the Reality of Time**
> By dividing your day into time blocks, "how much time is left today" becomes visible. View tasks as "time blocks" rather than a "list." If it doesn't fit, tomorrow is fine — you can make that judgment in 5 seconds.

## Add/Edit Sections

1. Open **Settings > Schedule** in the sidebar (or navigate to `/settings/schedule`).
2. You can add a new section with the **"Add New Section"** button.
3. Edit the section name (e.g., "Focus Time") and start time (e.g., "10:00").
4. Click `Save` to reflect changes in the main task list.

## Reflection on Schedule

The start time set for a section serves as a guide for task placement in the timeline view.
In Daily View, each section is displayed as a block, and you can move tasks between sections by drag & drop.
