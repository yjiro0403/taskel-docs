# Taskel Documentation

Welcome to **Taskel**.

Taskel is a task management OS for **Executors**, focusing on **"Execution"** rather than **"Management"**.

## Concept

- **Seamless Execution**: Start and complete tasks without interrupting your thought process.
- **Visualized Timeline**: Visualize remaining time and task volume to control anxiety.
- **Fact-Based**: Reflect based on actual performance, not just "feeling like you worked hard".

## Get Started

First, create an account and add your first task.
