# Taskel Documentation

Welcome to **Taskel**.

Taskel is a task management OS for **Executors**, focusing on **"Execution"** rather than **"Management"**.
An AI assistant supports your execution through "suggestions", while time calibration and daily reviews drive continuous growth.

## Concept

- **Seamless Execution**: Start and complete tasks without interrupting your thought process.
- **Visualized Timeline**: Visualize remaining time and task volume to control anxiety.
- **Fact-Based**: Reflect based on actual performance, not just "feeling like you worked hard".
- **AI-Assisted**: Add tasks, break down goals, and review your day through natural conversation.

## Who Is Taskel For?

- You have too many things to do and don't know where to start
- Your time estimates are always off from reality
- You want to manage tasks but don't want to spend time on management itself
- Your goals don't connect to your daily tasks
