> **Goals and today, always connected.**

**Turn your year into today's 30 minutes.**

Taskel is not a "task management tool."
It's an app that provides the experience of **bidirectionally connecting your annual goals with today's actions, running a daily cycle of execution, measurement, and reflection, so that both your goals and yourself are continuously refined**.

## The Seven Pillars of Taskel

| Pillar | Experience |
|---|---|
| 🎯 **Bidirectional Goal Connection** | Year → Month → Week → Today in one thread. Execution refines goals |
| ⏰ **Visualizing the Reality of Time** | Estimated end time shows "it won't fit" in 5 seconds |
| ▶️ **Execution Drive** | One-click timer bridges the gap from planning to execution |
| 🪞 **Self-Calibration (Time Mirror)** | Estimate vs. actual sharpens your time sense. AI is a mirror |
| 🛡️ **Psychological Safety** | Incomplete ≠ failure. Chute flows tasks to tomorrow |
| 🔄 **Habit Automation** | Routines line up automatically. Elimination of decision fatigue |
| 📊 **Action Selection Optimization** | Scoring helps you choose "what's next" with evidence |

## Design Philosophy

### Assist, not Delegate
AI is a "mirror." It doesn't estimate for you or change your priorities. You decide, so you grow.

### Incomplete is Not Punishment
Chute (postponement) is an official feature. Freedom from the "Overdue" red-letter hell.

### Goals Are Living Things
Changing doesn't mean failing — changing means growing. We welcome goal evolution.
